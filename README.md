# PortfolioSite

My portfolio site was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

I chose to use Angular to build my portfolio for several reasons. The first, was to practice using Angular. I enjoy working with Angular and find it to be very well documented. I also wanted my site to be a SPA and have smooth transitions between each routes. 

I also wrote a custom PHP script which allows a visitor of the site to send me emails through the contact form. 

Future implementations may feature a blog, cool UX/UI implementations and anything else that comes to mind!

Feel free to contact me if you have any commnents or questions. I'd love to chat!
